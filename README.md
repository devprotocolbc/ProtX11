# ProtX11 (Obsolete)

In the meanwhile it has been decided to move away from the very complex implementation of DX11 and move to the openGL lib immediatly instead. The first main version of ProtX will be an OGL implementation.

## Protocol X for DirectX 11

This is a first attempt on making a "homemade game engine". This is mainly for educational purposes, as it is the plan
to move to openGL on a later date. This version is mainly meant to learn the in's and outs of engine programming before
making my own interpretation of it.

### General Design choices

Decided to follow a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv8DnRaQOs5-MR-zbP1QUdq5FL0FWqVzg) for a first
version of ProtX. For a first training ground we will use DirectX 11. Branding it **ProtX11**. After this, the next idea
is to make a completely self developed one using OpenGL (**ProtX GL**?).

Chose C++ as a language, as I am not proficient at all, so it is a very good opportunity to learn.
